🎨🧠 Digit Recognizer using Deep Learning and Tkinter
This project is a GUI-based digit recognition app that allows users to draw digits on a canvas and get instant predictions using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

🔧 Tech Stack:
Python
TensorFlow & Keras
Tkinter (GUI)
PIL (Image Processing)
NumPy

✨ Features:
Real-time digit prediction from canvas input
Trained CNN model for high-accuracy results
Clean and interactive user interface
Image preprocessing for model compatibility

🔍 A great project to explore the combination of deep learning and desktop application development.
